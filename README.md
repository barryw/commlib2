#### Introduction

This is a reverse-engineered copy of the commlib2 library created by İlker Fıçıcılar. You can find instructions on his website here: http://cbm.ficicilar.name.tr/program/7/rs232-communication-library

To build, just run `make`. You will need to have `make` and `docker` installed since it uses my kickassembler docker image.
